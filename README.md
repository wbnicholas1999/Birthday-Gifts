## Section 3: Behind the Scenes

The “JOptionPane” outputs was really simple to use; I wished Mac and Linux users could’ve done something like this too, but I’m not sure if Eclipse would make some future update or if any of the computer companies would make a new operating system to allow the outputs. I was stuck on two parts; the first being the loop when you look for a toy for the child, I didn’t know what to do until I finally figured out I was incorrectly setting up the while loop; another being checking out if the toy is age appropriate, I went to a tutor to figure out what I need to do, and I just needed to use the double equal sign, considering it’s a Boolean input. I’ve made some few changes on the Driver file to make sure the program prints the output the way I want it, and I wanted to have an alternate message whenever someone doesn’t want to give the gift to the child after finding out the toy isn’t age appropriate.
